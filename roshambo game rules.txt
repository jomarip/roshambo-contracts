Which contract and what function do you use to create rock, paper, scissor card tokens?
League.sol with addLeague(rockNº, scissorNº, paperNº, starsNº)

Get the cards in the league by using getLeagueInfoById(leagueId) the leagueId is the array index of leagues.

Get the leagues data with leagues()

- Currently making the Game contract deployable by adding the required functions.

Each league has a card limit for each type. I.e: 20 rocks, 40 papers, 50 scissors

Those tokens are not created when the league starts. Tokens are created when people buy cards. Meaning you can buy as much as the league allows without exceeding the limit.

When you buy cards, you specify the number like 29 and you pay the right price. The types are random, they rotate so you can't buy a specific type of card.
